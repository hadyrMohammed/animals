            Lions
        </h2>
        <p>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera,
            native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; 
            and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
            It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
            A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
            preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates.
            The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

            Elephant
        </h2>
        <p>
            Elephants are the largest living land animals.
            Three living species are currently recognised:
            the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana),
            the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis),
            and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). 
            They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea;
            extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.
            Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin.
            The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging.
            The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.

            <p>
                The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia.
                It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws,
                a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes.
                It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies,
                though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
